abstract: "Swarms of the pelagic tunicate, *Thalia democratica*, form during spring, but the causes of the large interannual variability in the magnitude of salp swarms are unclear. Changes in asexual reproduction (buds per chain) of *T. democratica* populations in the coastal waters of south-east Australia (32–35°S) were observed in three austral springs (October 2008–2010). *T. democratica* abundance was significantly higher in 2008 (1,312 individuals m−3) than 2009 and 2010 (210 and 92 individuals m−3, respectively). There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression, r 2 = 0.61, F 1,22 = 33.83, P < 0.001) between abundance and asexual reproduction. Similarly, relative growth rates declined with decreasing abundance. Generalised additive mixed modelling showed that T. democratica abundance was significantly positively related to preferred food >2 μm in size (P < 0.05) and negatively related to the proportion of non-salp zooplankton (P < 0.001). Salp swarm magnitude, growth, and asexual reproduction may depend on the abundance of larger phytoplankton (prymnesiophytes and diatoms) and competition with other zooplankton."
