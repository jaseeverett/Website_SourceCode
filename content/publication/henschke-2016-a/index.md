abstract: "Large oceanic salps are rarely encountered. The highest recorded biomasses of the salps Thetys vagina (852 g WW m−3) and Cyclosalpa affinis (1149 g WW m−3) were observed in the Tasman Sea during January 2009. Due to their fast sinking rates the carcasses and faecal pellets of these and other large salps play a significant role in carbon transport to the seafloor. We calculated that faecal pellets from these swarms could have contributed up to 67 % of the mean organic daily carbon flux in the area. This suggests that the flux of carbon from salp swarms are not accurately captured in current estimates.This study contributes information on salp abundance and biomass to a relatively understudied field, improving estimates for biogeochemical cycles."
