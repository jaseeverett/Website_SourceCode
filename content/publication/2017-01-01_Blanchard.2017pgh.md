abstract = "Size-based ecosystem modeling is emerging as a powerful way to assess ecosystem-level impacts of human-and environment-driven changes from individual-level processes. These models have evolved as mechanistic explanations for observed regular patterns of abundance across the marine size spectrum hypothesized to hold from bacteria to whales. Fifty years since the first size spectrum measurements, we ask how far have we come? ..."
