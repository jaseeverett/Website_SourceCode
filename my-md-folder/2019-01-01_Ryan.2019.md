abstract = "Shark attacks are rare but traumatic events that generate social and economic costs and often lead to calls for enhanced attack mitigation strategies that are detrimental to sharks and other wildlife. Improved understanding of the influence of environmental conditions on shark attack risk may help to inform shark management strategies. Here, we developed predictive models for the risk of attack by white Carcharodon carcharias, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and bull/whaler Carcharhinus spp. sharks in Australian waters based on location â€¦"
